# MWL-detection-system
#This is a real-time mental workload detection system of pilots based on a wireless EEG headset.
#Multi-machine learning algorithms and Bayesian Neutral Network were considered in developing period.
#Sequential Float Feature selection and K-W test were used to found the optimal feature set.
#This system can be considered in other drving scenario such as autonomous driving and train transportation.
